Kubernetes Cluster Setup Instructions

MTU Configuration

When setting up your Kubernetes cluster, it's crucial to configure the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) correctly based on your 
network interface settings.Follow these steps to ensure proper MTU configuration:

Identify Your Network Interface

Run the following command to identify whether your network interface is named eth0 or enX0:

ip link show
Look for the network interface name in the output. It will be listed as eth0, enX0, or something similar.

Update Your Scripts

In your master and worker node scripts, update the network interface name accordingly. For example:

MASTER_PRIVATE_IP=$(ip addr show enX0 | awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
Replace enX0 with your actual network interface name if it is different.

Configure MTU in cni_callico.yml

In the cni_callico.yml file, set the MTU value based on the network interface you identified. 
This should match the MTU value you configure in the next step.

Set the MTU Value

To set the MTU value to 1440, use the following command:

sudo ip link set dev enX0 mtu 1440

Replace enX0 with the actual network interface name you identified earlier.

Verify the MTU Setting

After setting the MTU value, verify that it has been applied correctly by running:

ip link show
Check the output to ensure the MTU value for your network interface (enX0 or eth0) is set to 1440.
The output should look something like this:

2: enX0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1440 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 0a:a3:ed:bd:79:cd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
By following these steps, you will ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is configured with the correct MTU settings 
for optimal performance
